            <p>
                Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and
                the
                desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction,
                generality and individuality.

            <h3>— Marston Morse, American mathematician</h3>
            <p>
                Mathematics are the result of mysterious powers which no one understands, and which the unconscious
                recognition of beauty must play an important part. Out of an infinity of designs a mathematician chooses
                one pattern for beauty’s sake and pulls it down to earth.

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
